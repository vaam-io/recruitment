1. Meet up in online editor and make sure it works and is in markdown mode with the following content: ` ```typescript ``` `
2. Start stopwatch for 30 minutes. Remind them when there is 5 minutes left. 
3. Tell them the scenario: "I'm gonna paste in some code written by a junior developer. There might be any sort of bugs and problems with it, and we want you to review it with us. We recommend you take a few minutes to go over the code and then start pointing out any issues you find."
4. Paste the code inside the typescript markers. 
5. When they point an issue, we acknowledge* it and ask how they would solve it. After they've explained, we suggest that they go ahead and make the change.

*Note: there might be rare cases of issues that are just non-issues or on the wrong level of detail. If they for instance point out that the components should be in separate files, then we note it and commend them for pointing it out, but we have them keep working in the same file.
